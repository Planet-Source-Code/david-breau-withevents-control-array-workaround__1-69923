## Withevents Control Array Workaround


</div>

### Description

One limiting thing about VB is the inability to use the withevents keyword with a control array or any array. This is probably the simplest way to get around that. It involves using two classes. The backend class acts as the skeleton which declares "Public withevents object as object type" The front end class (the class with which you will interface) gets around array withevents by creating an array of the backend class thus creating a withevents array of objects.

Difficult to explain but easy to understand once you download it now. Dont forget to vote............for Ron Paul :)
